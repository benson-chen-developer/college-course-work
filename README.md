Mips-Assembly
    - We learned how to store data at a byte per byte basis. We would manipulate
      the location of data in the memory to write functions and learned how 
      to code in assembly. 
    - The test.asm files were to for compiling our hw.asm files and storing data in
      variables. The hw.asm files were our submission and the code that solved our 
      homework.
